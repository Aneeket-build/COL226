# COL226 - Programming Languages
This repository contains the assignmnets undertaken and useful materials for 2024's spring semester offering by Professor Sanjiva Prasad.

# References
- Though the notes would be sufficient, *The Art of Prolog* by Shapiro and Sterling would be an excellent reading.
- For practice problems, refer to the following sources
  1. (https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs421/fa2015/mps/index.html). In the url, change year from 2015 to earler to access more problems.

  3. (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~svb/AssuredSoftware/notes.pdf) Excellent notes for the imperative WHILE language.

# Assignments
- No assignment in the course was autograded. Therefore, in most cases I have tried to extend my code to incorporate more features.
- Please think through the logic for the problem before seeing my solutions in case you have received the same assignment.
